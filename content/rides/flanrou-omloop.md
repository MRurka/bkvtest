NEW FOR 2018 – OUR ‘BELGIAN CLASSIC’ – 100% ON TARMAC.
SATURDAY 17th MARCH 2018
9am for 10am staggered starts of 10 riders (Sign on from 8am onwards)

Draycott Memorial Hall Latches Lane, Draycott, Nr.Cheddar, Somerset BS27 3UE

Burning inside us since the very start – this early season opener is held on the same day as Milan San-Remo. Routed on tarmac but on back lanes with similar parcours that you will see being raced on E3 Harelbeke (March 23), Ghent-Wevelgem (March 25), Dwars Door Vlaanderen (March 28) or Tour of Flanders (April 1st).

Perfect hard surface training if you’re heading out to one of those Flandrian fondo rides or just looking for winter motivation for training to get your season off to a flying start… there will be a Belgian flavour at the spacious and warm hall to welcome you back in too. Very restricted numbers and always our route signage will help guide you.

ONLINE ENTRY via BRITISH CYCLING
(And no, you do not need BC membership)
Only £25.00
