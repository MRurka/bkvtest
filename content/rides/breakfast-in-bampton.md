We're going to Bampton..... probably a 100km ride.

<!--more-->
The route has been worked out by Guy and can be downloaded here – takes in a few
climbs before the coffee stop at 40-odd miles. We went here a few weeks ago and
its a good place to stop – there’s a decent hot food option as well.

Register if you are coming.

Early start though
