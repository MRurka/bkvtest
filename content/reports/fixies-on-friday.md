After a bit of confusion over the start point, and a bail-out from James due to Friday traffic, the two Alan’s and myself wandered around the levels for a few miles before ending up at The Crossway’s Inn for a quick one (or two in Alan B’s case!).

We debated while riding whether the point of the Friday Fixie ride was a group ride with an added bonus of a drink at the pub OR the other way around. The jury’s still out on that question.
