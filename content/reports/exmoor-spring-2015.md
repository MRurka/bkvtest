Not really a ride report…. more a list of thanks.

<!--more-->
*  Richard Miles and the fine folk at Minehead CC for organising such a wonderful event – the route is spectacular (if a little exposed to the wind) and the volunteers do a great job. The cream tea at the end is a fantastic way to finish off!
*  To Gary Scarlett aka @gazwagon for taking some snaps at a challenging little kick on the route.
*  To Trevor for ferrying 4/6 of the crew in the “Banter Bus”.
*  To the all of the BKV chaps for making the ride great fun – the banter today was out of the top drawer!
